2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell comp1/agb_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) comp1/agb_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell comp2/agb_reg_i_1__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) comp2/agb_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch comp1/aeb_reg/L7 (in comp1/aeb_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin comp1/aeb_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch comp1/agb_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin comp1/agb_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch comp1/alb_reg/L7 (in comp1/alb_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin comp1/alb_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch comp2/aeb_reg/L7 (in comp2/aeb_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin comp2/aeb_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch comp2/agb_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin comp2/agb_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch comp2/alb_reg/L7 (in comp2/alb_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin comp2/alb_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
